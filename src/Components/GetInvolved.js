      <h2>Choir</h2>
      <p>If you are new to Music 4 All, we suggest you start with one of the CHOIR
programs. There is one for elementary, one for secondary and one adult
group for those folks who have completed school. These are weekly, 30-
minute group zoom meetings that feature voice building exercises, song
preparation and creative movement. Itâ€™s a high-energy time of singing
exploration. CHOIR programs are an economical way to start, at $10 per
student per month.</p>
      <h2>Group Instruction</h2>
<p>Class voice instruction is for the student who wants more individualized
attention. Typically five students, each class concentrates on vocal
exercises and song preparation. Students of all abilities and levels of
verbal expression will be accommodated. Classes meet on Zoom weekly
for 30 minutes and are $40 per month.</p>
      <h2>Private Instruction</h2>
<p>For the serious students, we offer private voice lessons conducted through
Zoom. These are more intense, and require outside practice time to
progress. Private lessons are weekly, 30-minute sessions and cost $80 per
month.</p>
