      <p>
      Cindy Van Horn has been bringing her love of music to students of all ages
  for over 35 years. She directs childrenâ€™s choirs, teaches class and private
  voice lessons, and directs a special education enrichment program in the
  public school system. This special education program has become her
  major focus in the last five years. She wants to build a program where
  people of all ages with special needs can access the joy of music
  experience and performance. Music 4 All is that program.
  Music 4 All is a program designed to teach music appreciation and
  education through activities tailored to people with special needs. All
  musicians ages 5 to 95 are encouraged to participate. There is a Music 4
  All program for all levels of ability and experience.
